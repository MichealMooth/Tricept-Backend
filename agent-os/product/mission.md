## The Problem

### Skill Visibility Gap

Organizations struggle to maintain accurate, up-to-date information about employee competencies. Without systematic tracking, managers make staffing decisions based on outdated information or personal assumptions. This leads to misaligned project assignments, overlooked talent, and reactive rather than strategic workforce development.

**Our Solution:** A dual-assessment approach combining self-assessment with peer validation, temporal tracking for historical trends, and visual matrix displays for instant skill visibility.

### Capacity Planning Blindness

Teams lack visibility into how employee time is allocated across projects and initiatives. This results in overcommitment, burnout, and missed deadlines when hidden capacity constraints surface too late.

**Our Solution:** Monthly capacity allocation tracking with visual overviews, enabling proactive workload balancing and realistic project planning.

### Strategic Goal Disconnect

Employees often lack visibility into organizational strategic goals and their personal contribution to achieving them. This creates misalignment between daily work and company objectives.

**Our Solution:** Traffic-light rating system for strategic goals with employee-level tracking, creating transparency and accountability for strategic initiatives.

## Differentiators

### Dual Assessment Model
Unlike single-source skill tracking tools, Tricept combines self-assessment with peer assessment to provide validated, multi-perspective skill ratings. This reduces bias and increases accuracy, resulting in more trustworthy skill data for staffing decisions.

### Temporal Skill History
Unlike point-in-time skill snapshots, Tricept maintains historical skill records with validity periods. This enables trend analysis, growth tracking, and understanding of how skills evolve over time, providing context that single-point assessments cannot offer.

### Integrated Workforce View
Unlike fragmented HR tools, Tricept combines skill assessment, capacity planning, and strategic goal tracking in one platform. This holistic view enables informed decisions that consider skills, availability, and strategic priorities together.

### Enterprise-Ready Architecture
Unlike lightweight skill tracking spreadsheets, Tricept provides role-based access control, audit trails, and scalable architecture. This meets enterprise security and compliance requirements while maintaining ease of use.
